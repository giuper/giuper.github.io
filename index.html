<p>
I am a professor of Computer Science at the 
Dipartimento di Scienze Aziendali -- Management of Innovation Systems of the
<a href=https://web.unisa.it/en/home>Universit&agrave; di Salerno</a>, Salerno, Italy.
</p>


<p>
I got my <i>Laurea in Science dell'Informazione</i> cum laude, in 1986 from
Salerno, my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Harvard University in 1988,
and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard University in 1992.
Between Salerno and Harvard, I worked for Olivetti, in Ivrea, Italy.
</p>

<p>
I have been an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the 
<i>Dipartimento di Matematica</i> of the Universit&agrave; di Catania, Catania, Italy, from 1992 to 1994. 
Then I moved to Salerno as a Professor of Computer Science.
</p>

<p>
My main research area is Theoretical Computer Science with a special focus
on Cryptography.

<i> Lower Bounds for Encrypted Multi-Maps and Searchable Encryption in the Leakage Cell Probe Mode</i>
<a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1132>ePrint 2019-1132</a>
Accepted to CRYPTO 20.

<p>
We present  strong  evidence  that  the  leakage  of  the  global  key-equality  pattern  is  inherent  for  any  dynamic EMM construction with O(1) efficiency.
In particular,  we consider the slightly smaller leakage 
where leakage of key-equality between update and query operations is
decoupled and the adversary only learns whether two operations of the
same type are performed on the same key or not. 
We show that any EMM with at most decoupled key-equality pattern leakage incurs
&Omega;(log n) overhead in the leakage cell probe model. 
This is tight as there exist ORAM-based constructions of EMMs with logarithmic slowdown that leak no more than the decoupled key-equality pattern (and actually, much less).
