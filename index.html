I am a professor of Computer Science at the 
Dipartimento di Scienze Aziendali -- Management of Innovation Systems of the
<a href=https://web.unisa.it/en/home>Universit&agrave; di Salerno</a>.
</p>

<p>
I got my <i>Laurea in Science dell'Informazione</i> cum laude, in 1986 from
Salerno, my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Harvard University in 1988,
and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard University in 1992.
Between Salerno and Harvard, I worked for Olivetti, in Ivrea, Italy.

<p>
I have been an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the 
<i>Dipartimento di Matematica</i> of the Universit&agrave; di Catania from 1992 to 1994. 
Then I moved to Salerno as a Professor of Computer Science.
