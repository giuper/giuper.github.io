    <h1>The anamorphic papers </h1>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    
    There has been a long line of work trying to cripple and limit
    encryption. The most extreme cases are often found in dictatorships,
    more democratic governments have often expressed uncomfortable feelings
    regarding the widespread use of strong encryption in the context
    of online communication.
    The following is a quote of David Cameron, January 2015:
        <i>In our country, do we want to allow 
        a means of communication between people 
        which even in extremis, with a signed 
        warrant from the Home Secretary personally, 
        that we cannot read?</i>
    (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/12/uk-spy-agencies-need-more-powers-says-cameron-paris-attacks">here</a>)
This can create and indeed has already created tension 
between industry or privacy advocates and governments, known as 
<i>Crypto Wars</i>.
    
<p>
Numerous non-direct arguments against such policies have been raised, 
such as "<i>the bad guys can utilize other encryption system</i>" 
so all other cryptosystems have to be declared illegal, or that 
"<i>allowing the government access is an ill-advised policy since it creates a natural weak systems security point, which may attract others (to masquerade as the government)</i>". 
<br>
The notion of an <i>Anamorphic Encryption</i>, introduced in 
<a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/639>[PPY22]</a>, 
is a <i>technical</i> demonstration of the futility of the Crypto Wars:
even if the dictator gets the keys and the messages used in the system 
(before anything is sent) and no other system is allowed, 
there is a covert way within the context of well established 
public-key cryptosystems for an entity to immediately (with no latency)
send piggybacked secure messages which are, in spite of the stringent conditions, still hidden.
