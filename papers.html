<h1>The lower bound papers</h1>
In this sequence of papers, I look at the intrinsinc complexity of 
oblivios data structures with a special focus on ORAM and PIR.

<p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The first lower bound on ORAMs was given by 
<a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/28395.28416>Goldreich</a> in 
the first 1987 paper on ORAMs (see also <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/233551.233553>Goldreich and Ostrovsky</a>).
The lower bound was in the balls-and-bins model in which each logical
block of data was seen as an indivisible and opaque blob of data.
And it holds also for the offline case.

<li>
<a href=https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/oram_lower.html>Boyle and Naor</a> showed that removing the balls-and-bins restriction on the lower bound for the offline case would give a result on sorting circuit complexity.

<li>
<a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96881-0_18>Larsen and Nielsen</a> removed the ball-and-bins restriction for 
online ORAMs and proved that an ORAM consisting on <i>n</i>
<i>b</i>-bit blocks implemented on a server with <i>w</i>-bit words 
requires slowdown proportional to at least <i>b/w log(n/c)</i>.
<li>
<a hfef=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36033-7_10>Hubáček, Koucký, Král,
and Slívová</a> had the same lower bound with respect to a weaker
adversary. 
</ul>


<h3>The papers</h3>

<ul>

<li>With Kevin Yeo, 
in <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-17653-2_14>Eurocrypt 2019</a>, we obtain the same lower bound for the weaker notion of 
<i>(&epsilon;,&delta;)-differentially private</i> RAM, for constant &epsilon;.

<li>With Kevin Yeo and Sarvar Patel, 
in <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-56784-2_15>Crypto 2020</a>, we show the same result for Symmetric Searchable Encryption 
that leak the <i>decoupled key-equality pattern</i>; i.e.,
the key-equality leakage between update and query operations is decoupled
and the adversary only learns whether two operations of the <i>same type</i>
are performed on the same key or not. Note that constant-slowdown SSE is possible if the adversary is allowed to learn whether a pair of read and write
operation are performed on the same key.

<li>With Kevin Yeo, 
in <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30545-0_17>Eurocrypt 2023</a>,
we provide a framework for proving lower bounds for differentially private
and oblivious data structures.
As a special case we prove the first non-trivial lower bound for
differentially private RAMs that is independent of the size <i>b</i> of
the logical blocks. Note that previous lower bound had a <i>b/w</i>
multiplicative factor that made the bound trivial when <i>b</i> is 
much larger than <i>w</i>.
A similar result had been obtained by 
<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84259-8_20>Komargodski and Lin</a>
for the stronger notion of Oblivious RAM.

<li>With Kevin Yeo, 
in <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38551-3_6>CRYPTO 2023</a>,
we prove that differentially private RAMs have the same slowdown even
with respect to a transiente adversary that receives two memory snapshot
and the transcript of one operation.

<li>With Kevin Yeo, 
in <a href=https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977073.99>SODA 22</a>,
we prove a lower bound on the time/hint tradeoff of 
computationally secure PIR with public preprocessing
improving the previous result of
<a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-004-0134-y>Beimel, Ishai and Malkin</a>.
